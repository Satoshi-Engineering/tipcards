# Usage

Do not add frontend or backend properties here. Only add inputs and outputs of trpc requests (called dto, data transfer object)

Developers encouraged to use these types in backend/frontend code too, but if you need extra (or similar) fields extend the types in the respective src directories.

## Naming convention

Postfix classes and filenames with Dto (data transfer object).

e.g. `CardDto.ts` instead of just `Card.ts`
