# Usage

Do not add frontend or backend properties here. Only add inputs and outputs of trpc requests (called dto, data transfer object)

Backend and frontend are encouraged to use these types, but if you need extra (or similar) fields extend the types in the respective src directories.

## Naming convention

Postfix classes and filenames with Dto (data transfer object).

e.g. `CardDto.ts` instead of just `Card.ts`
