## A tip card system based on LNbits and the lightning network

Lightning TipCards are a tip (or gift) card system, where you can fund tip cards via the lightning network
and the gifted person can redeem the funded cards. The gifted person gets a short introduction to bitcoin and a lightning
app recommendation to start their journey into the bitcoin rabbit hole.

It is an open-source project developed and operated for the benefit of the Bitcoin community,
with a focus on "How to gentle orange pill nocoiners" - and without warranty of any kind.

[LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) is used for the wallet and lightning payments in the background.
