# Guidlines

- Use the git-hooks!
- `/scripts` folder: Helper script for local development tasks
- Unit tests have to run on every machine after running npm install

## Coding Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **Folder:** camelcase, first letter lowercase
- **Files:** camelcase, first letter: if class uppercase otherwise lowercase

#### Exceptions

- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: because this is defined by gitlab CI
  - Because of this, the folder `gitlab-ci` is the same as the yml file
- package-lock.json
